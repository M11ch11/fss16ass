Project Proposal:
Compare naive Bayes classifier with a number if different classifiers in terms of performance on different data sets, 
then look for instabilities in :
(a) The performance of the models (or)
(b)The structure of the learned models
across different groupings of the data, then find out why naive bayes performs better of worse than the other models
on that particular dataset. 
Our work will be based on the work in the paper http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~isbell/reading/papers/bayes-opt.pdf
The datasets will be taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
Suggestions are welcome!
