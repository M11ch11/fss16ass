The four most important keywords:
ii1 Codon
A sequence of three nucleotides which form a specific amino acid. You find codons in the DNA, mRNA and tRNA. The three nucleotides form a code.
ii2 FACIL
Means Fast and Accurate Genetic Code Inference and Logo. It's the tool they present in their paper to evaluate nucleic acid sequences for their genetic code that detects alternative codes even in species distantly related to known organisms.
ii3 Homology-based
Proteins that are evolutionarily related to each other have similar structures. Proteins are in addition are better conserved than amino acid structures. 
ii4 Globobulimina pseudospinescens
Is a single-celled organism, it is a inhabitant of the sea.

Brief Description
iii1  Motivational statements
      Forecast the weather is a challenging task. The use of data mining technologies can be a valuable instrument.
iii2  Hypotheses
      Given enough data, Data Mining techniques can be used for weather forecasting and climate change studies (s. paper)
iii3  Checklists
      data collection of 120months, Jan 2000 - Dec 2009
iii4  Related Work
      just mentioned that there is a number of methods and refers to that paper: Elia G. P., 2009, “A Decision Tree for Weather
Prediction”
iii5  Study instruments
      They use Artifical Neuronal Networks and Decision trees.
iii6  Statistical tests
      To say which weather forecasting mechanism is the best, they evaluate using Correlation Coefficient, Mean Squared Error, Mean-squared Error
iii7  Commentary
      They do not comment on the techniques of their statistical tests
iii8  Informative visualizations
      They use table summaries, and some graphs
iii9  Baseline results
      the changes of the clima could be studied and with the artifical neuronal networks it is possible to predict based on the data, without any further programming. But they claim more data. 
iii10 Sampling procedures
      Due to the large amount of data collected between 2000 and 2009 the wanted to use it using the methods for data mining ie decision tree algorithms and artifical neuronal networks
iii11 Patterns
      Data Cleaning, Data Selection, Data Transformation and Data Mining.
iii12 Negative results
      the mean error was about 50.8%, repectively 42.5%.
iii13 Tutorial materials
      They explain decision tree and artifical neuronal networks and give an overview about it.
iii14 New results 
      There were no really new results
iii15 Future work
      They want to use more data, that means data that is collected over decades. and they promise that newer models could be used in the future to predcit the weather.
iii16 Data 
      Meteorological data collected between 2000 and 2009 from the city of Ibadan,
Nigeria. 
iii17 Scripts
      The C5 Decision Tree algorithm was selected and the Lavenberg-Marquet algorithm was used to train the networks.
iii18 Sample models
iii19 Delivery tools 

Improve paper
iv1 the decision is quite short, there is no real discussion
iv2 they only refer to one paper that shoul show the related work. they are not comparing their results to other methods
iv3 they could shorten the basic explanation on the first pages, because someone who does research on that topic already knows that basic stuff
iv4 the decision tree could be illustrated to get a more intuitive view about the result.
