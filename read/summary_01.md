<h3>The four most important keywords:</h3>
<ul><li>
</li><li>ii1 Random Forest
Random Forest is a machine learning technique. At training time the algorithm develops a forest of decision trees. The mode of the classes is the output.

</li><li>ii2 Curse Of Dimensionality
Is a term that describes the fast increasing of a volumina while adding more dimensions. Data sets in life science normally have a lot more variables than samples. The number of parameters in life sience you have to consider is very large.

</li><li>ii3 Local Variable Importance
It's the importance of a variable for a single sample. Local variables that have a certain importance for a subset of all samples can be important for classifying, even though they weren't considered as an important global variable.

</li><li>ii4 Variable Interactions
Interactions between variables can cause an effect, respectively variables can sometimes become important when they interact with other variables, in particular in life science.
</li></ul>
<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<ul><li>
</li><li>iii1  Motivational statements
In life sciences much data is collected and analyzed. The variables often interfere with each other. With Random Forest it's possible to take those interactions to account.
</li><li>iii2  Hypotheses
Random Forest can extract the interactions and so enable a good insight.
</li><li>iii3  Checklists
The base of the Random Forest is built upon a data matrix which consists of examples that belong to two classes and measurements of each sample. A bootstrap set is created, variables are randomly chosen and evaluated.
</li><li>iii4  Related Work
There are links that show that Random Forest is discussed in a broad scientific context.
</li><li>iii5  Study instruments
Random Forest
</li><li>iii6  Statistical tests
variable-related information, proximity between examples, relationships and variable interactions
</li><li>iii7  Commentary
They recommend the 'randomForest' Package, but considering the performance also 'Random Jungle'. There are some other implementations that suite the kind of data of life sciences
</li><li>iii8  Informative visualizations
They use table summaries, and few figures
</li><li>iii9  Baseline results
With Random Forest it is possible to extract additional knowledge, as well as local importances, proximity and interactions. 
</li><li>iii10 Sampling procedures
It is not clear, which data they use or where exactly it comes from
</li><li>iii11 Patterns
Develop a Random Forest and analyze it
</li><li>iii12 Negative results
</li><li>iii13 Tutorial materials
They explain how Random Forest works and describe the speciality of life sciences
</li><li>iii14 New results 
They propose the Random Forest as good choice especially because of the interactions that can be analyzed
</li><li>iii15 Future work
</li><li>iii16 Data 
Much Life science data of different kinds.
</li><li>iii17 Scripts
They have no deeper insight, which implementation they use.
</li><li>iii18 Sample models
</li><li>iii19 Delivery tools
